iOS Rolodex Application to help manage long-distance personal relationships with friends and family. The app keeps track of the last time you called someone from the App. Users can take notes after the call to help remember important milestones in the lives of friends and family. The Home page offers Snooze or Call buttons for each user. Call places a real phone call to that contact and Snooze randomly generates another contact. The inspiration for this app was moving away from home and wanting to do a better job staying in touch with family and friends, rather than just viewing their social media page. Before COVID, I enjoyed calling friends and family on my drive home from work. Future dev work on this app would make it more like a relationship manager for personal contacts and potentially business contacts. 

Use cases:
Push notifications to remember to call someone on a recurring basis (ex, call Mom every Sunday)
Push notifications about today's birthdays and upcoming birthdays.
Users can take notes about phone calls, so that the next time they speak to a friend / family member that they haven't spoken to in a while they can easily remember/reference what was going on in that person's life the last time you talked.
